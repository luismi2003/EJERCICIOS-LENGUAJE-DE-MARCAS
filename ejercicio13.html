<h2>The border-color Property</h2>
<p>This property specifies the color of the four borders:</p>

<p class="one">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
<p class="two">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
<p class="three">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
<p class="four">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The "border-color" property does not work if it is used alone. Use the "border-style" property to set the borders first.</p>
